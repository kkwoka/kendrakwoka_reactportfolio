# Kendra Kwoka's Portfolio
This website portrays my professional web development skills to future employers and coworkers. On the 'Portfolio' page is a list of projects I have worked on or created by myself. Both the link to the Github code itself and the deployment link (if available) are on each project. Please click on each link for every project to get a true sense of my capabilities as a Web Developer.
